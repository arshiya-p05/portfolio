      <h3>Blockchain-Based Healthcare Data Security and Privacy</h3>
      <p>
        This project aims to enhance the security and privacy of healthcare data by implementing a blockchain-based framework. 
        It addresses the limitations of traditional centralized systems by introducing a decentralized, tamper-proof architecture 
        for storing and sharing electronic medical records. Using cryptographic techniques such as hashing, digital signatures, 
        and smart contracts, the system ensures data integrity, secure authentication, and controlled access. The use of private 
        blockchain networks and distributed ledger technology allows for transparent and trustworthy interactions between 
        patients, providers, and insurers, while maintaining strict privacy standards.
